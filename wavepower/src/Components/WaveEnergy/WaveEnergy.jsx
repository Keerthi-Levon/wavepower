        <div className="wave-description">
          <p>
            Wave energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources
            available today. It uses the natural and continuous movement of ocean
            waves to generate clean electricity without producing harmful emissions.
            Since oceans cover a large part of the Earth’s surface, wave energy
            offers an abundant and reliable source of renewable power.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the key advantages of wave energy is its reliability. Ocean
            waves are more predictable and consistent compared to solar and wind
            energy. Wave energy systems can generate power day and night, making
            them suitable for long-term energy planning.
          </p>

          <p>
            As energy demand continues to grow worldwide, wave energy plays an
            important role in building a diversified and resilient renewable
            energy mix.

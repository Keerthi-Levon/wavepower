        <h3>What is Wave Power?</h3>

        <p>
          Wave power is a renewable energy technology that captures the natural
          movement of ocean waves and converts it into electricity.
        </p>

        <p>
          As waves rise and fall, specially designed systems capture this motion
          and transform it into usable power. Unlike fossil fuels, wave energy
          produces zero emissions and has minimal environmental impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because ocean waves are constant and predictable, wave power provides
          a reliable source of clean energy, supporting a sustainable and
          low-carbon future.
